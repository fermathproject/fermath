Fermath Conversions V0.5
*removed id from class unit (and methods that use it)
*added operators =,==,!= to operations class in operations.h (also changed operations_test.cpp)
*added operators =,==,!=,+ to unit class in unit.h (also changed unit_test.cpp)
*added new template add_vector in templates.h (also changed templates_test.cpp)
*added operators =,==,!=,+ to magnitude class in magnitude.h (also changed magnitude_test.cpp)
*changed operator+ in class variable in variable.h
*added operators =,==,!= to class variable in variable.h
*new file called variable_test.cpp to test class variable
*small changes in const methods of classes
**functions.h unchanged

Fermath Conversions V0.4
*added templates.h and templates_test.cpp, some templates for read/writing vectors
*added write/read operations in a binary file in operations.h and contructor from file
*added operator << to class unit in unit.h
*all math neccesary for operations class is now in the operations class in operation.h as private methods
*now the principal name and symbol of an unit are the first and second string of names vector
*new file functions.h with some useful functions for Fermath and function_test.cpp to test functions.h
*all .h files are now in the /include directory
